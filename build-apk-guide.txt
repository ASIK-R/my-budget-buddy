EXPENSE TRACKER APK BUILDING GUIDE
=================================

LOCATION OF ANDROID PROJECT:
E:\ASIK Work station\App - Projects\Expance Treaker\expense-tracker-android

WHERE THE APK WILL BE CREATED:
E:\ASIK Work station\App - Projects\Expance Treaker\expense-tracker-android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

STEPS TO BUILD THE APK USING ANDROID STUDIO:

1. OPEN THE PROJECT IN ANDROID STUDIO:
   a. Launch Android Studio
   b. Select "Open an existing project"
   c. Navigate to: 
      E:\ASIK Work station\App - Projects\Expance Treaker\expense-tracker-android
   d. Click "OK"

2. WAIT FOR GRADLE TO SYNC:
   - This may take 2-5 minutes
   - You'll see progress in the status bar
   - If prompted to update Gradle, click "Don't remind me again"

3. BUILD THE APK:
   a. Click "Build" in the menu bar
   b. Select "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)"
   c. Click "Build APK"

4. LOCATE THE APK:
   a. After building completes, a notification will appear
   b. Click "locate" in the notification
   OR
   c. Manually navigate to:
      expense-tracker-android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\
   d. Find the file: app-debug.apk

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The APK file does NOT exist until you complete these steps
- All your Expense Tracker files are embedded in the APK
- The app works offline without internet connection
- The APK will be about 2-3 MB in size

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If Android Studio asks to update Gradle, click "Don't remind me again"
- If you see build errors, make sure you have internet connection
- The first build may take longer than subsequent builds
- Make sure you have at least 4GB of free disk space

JAVA COMPATIBILITY ISSUES:
You're experiencing Java version compatibility issues (class file major version 65 = Java 21).
Android Studio handles these automatically, which is why it's the recommended approach.

ALTERNATIVE METHOD (If you must use command line):
1. Install Java JDK 11 (not Java 21)
2. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
3. Run: .\gradlew.bat assembleDebug

But using Android Studio is strongly recommended for the best experience.
